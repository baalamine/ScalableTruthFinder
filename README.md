# Scalable Truth Finder using Rheem 

The aims of this project is to provide a scalable version of TruthFinder algorithm, a truth discovery algorithm that harness 
correlations between similar claim values in order to improve the accuracy of a classical data fusion scenario where sources 
are overlapping on same object attributes, but they provide conflicting values.

Basically, we will rely on Rheem, an agile distributed data processing framework developed by the data analytic group at Qatar Computing Research Institute. Rheem provide three distinctive features: 1. it allows users to easily specify their jobs with easy-to-use interfaces, 2. it provides developers with opportunities to optimize performance in different ways, and 3. it can run on any execution platform, such as Spark or MapReduce and combinations of those.
