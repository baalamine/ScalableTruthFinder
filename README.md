# Scalable Truth Finder using Rheem 

The aims of this project is to provide a scalable version of TruthFinder algorithm, a truth discovery algorithm that harness 
correlations between similar claim values in order to improve the accuracy of a classical data fusion scenario where sources 
are overlapping on same object attributes, but they provide conflicting values.
